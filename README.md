# 100 Percentage Use of Computers


In our architecture, we used cloud, fog, and edge computing, and each calculation was dispersed evenly across each tier. This makes our system more sophisticated and efficient.

We will provide you with two devices, a camera and a smartwatch. Within these two devices and supported by universal software, your inpatient will be significantly safer.

May update overtime
